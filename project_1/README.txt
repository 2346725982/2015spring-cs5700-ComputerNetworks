Running Environment:
Using Python to implement Client.
Need no complier.

Challenges:
1. Have no idea how to build the robust code.
2. Have a tough time writing README

High-Level approach:
In this project,we learned some python programming skills and by using the lib of python we realize the required functions. We received data from the server and send the result of the data to the host.

At first we think it is complex to compute the result,because it has four conditions.So we refer to some materials online,and find a method named eval,we can directly get the result and send it back to the  server.

By running our code and test it, we succeeded in geting the secret flag.
