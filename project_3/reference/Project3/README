—-—- Analysis.py					TCL parse program source Codes


The source code has two parts
part1 : tcl script - run simulations using ns-2, and generate trace file.
part2 : python script - parse the trace file of ns-2

PART1 - tcl scripts
  
  FUNCTION:
    - set up network according to topology
    - arrage flow schedule
    - record packet trace file
  
  CHALLENGE:
    - default TCP flow window_ = 20
	  set TCP flow window_ = 1000000
	  in order to utilize full potential of network

PART2 - python script

  FUNCTION:
	- parsing tracefile according to trace format
	- calculate performance related evaluatoion value 
	  (throughput, latency, drop rate)
  
  CHALLENGE:
    - manage a list to record the status of sended packet
	  for the caculation of latency
