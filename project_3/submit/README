Methodology:

Experiment 1: TCP Performance Under Congestion
GOAL:
In this experiment, we are asked to set different CBR flow rate and test several TCP variantsâ€™ performance.

METHOD:
By setting CBR rate, we will compute throughput, latency, drop rate of each TCP variant to illustration how good they could perform.

Experiment 2: Fairness Between TCP Variants
GOAL:
In this experiment, our goal is to test the allocation of a bandwidth while running 2 different TCP variants on it.

METHOD:
By combining different variants, we will calculate throughput, latency, drop rate for each TCP variants under competition.

By setting the variable random as True, we set the sending packet behavior of CBR as randomly.

Experiment 3: Influence of Queuing
GOAL:
In this experiment, we need to test the influence of the queuing discipline used by nodes on the overall throughput of flows.

METHOD:
By setting queue type, we will compute throughput, latency, drop rate to test the performance of the TCP variants and see how queue type would affect performance.

Formula:
Throughput = TransferSize / TransferTime
TransferTime = TCPSEndtime - TCPStarttime

PacketLosses = PacketSend - PacketReceived
PacketLossesRatio = PacketLosses / PacketReceived

Latency = TotalLatency / PacketReceived
TotalLatency = Sum (PacketReceivedTime - PacketSentTime)
