Running Environment:Using Python to write this program.Need no complier.Challenges:1. At first, we don’t know how the HTTP protocol works and don’t understand clearly what each part of POST/GET request means.2. After we sent a request to the server, we will get a response from the server. We don’t know how to gather the useful information from the response messages. 3. When we finished the first version of the crawler, it will takes a long time to get all the secret flags.4. We do not know how to correctly handle all kinds of HTTP status Code.High-Level approach:In this project, we learned some python programming skills and by using the lib of python we get to know how the HTTP protocol works and the meaning of each part of the HTTP GET/POST messages. We write a web crawler to traverse all the URLS in the website, and search for the secret flags. To overcoming the challenges, we read the materials named “HTTP Made Really Easy” to understand how the HTTP protocol works and the meaning of each part of the message. And then we use two ways to gather useful information from the response message: BeautifulSoup and regular expression. At last we use multithreading to make the running speed much quicker.
